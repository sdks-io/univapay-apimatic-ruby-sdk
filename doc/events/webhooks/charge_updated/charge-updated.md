# Implementation example of handling the `chargeUpdated` event (with no signature verification) in Rails.

require 'rails'
require 'action_controller/railtie'
require 'univapay_client_sdk'

include UnivapayClientSdk

# Define route
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/webhooks/receive', to: 'webhooks#receive'
end

# Define controller
class WebhooksController < ActionController::API
  def receive
    # Step 1: Create the handler.

    # Step 2: Parse the request into a typed event.
    event = handler.parse_event(request)

    # Step 3: Pattern match on the event types and handle it.
    if event.is_a?(ChargeUpdatedWebhookCallback) && event.event == 'charge_updated'
